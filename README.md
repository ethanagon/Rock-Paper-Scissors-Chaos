# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Chaos

This was a final project for Professor Alex Barnett's Chaos class at Dartmouth in fall of 2015. I modelled the evolving strategies of players in a modified rock paper scissors game which results in chaotically evolving strategies. Essentially serves as a windowpane into evolutionary game theory.

Included here is the code for the model (RPS.m and game.m) and the slideshow I used to aid my presentation (Chaos Project Presentation.pptx). The model itself is not included because I don't have a MATLAB license right now and haven't been able to run it and verify that it's running well.
